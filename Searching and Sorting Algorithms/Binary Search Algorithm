Binary Search-
-------------------
 

Binary Search is one of the fastest searching algorithms.
It is used for finding the location of an element in a linear array.
It works on the principle of divide and conquer technique.
 

Binary Search Algorithm can be applied only on Sorted arrays.
                                               --------------
So, the elements must be arranged in-
----------------------------------------

Either ascending order if the elements are numbers.
Or dictionary order if the elements are strings.
 

To apply binary search on an unsorted array,

First, sort the array using some sorting technique.
Then, use binary search algorithm
----------------------------------------Code----------------------------
#include<iostream>
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int BinarySearch(int arr[],int n,int key)
{
    
    int beg =0;
    int end= n-1;
    int mid = (beg+end)/2;
    while(beg<=end)
    {
        if(arr[mid] == key)
        {
            return mid;
        }
        else if(arr[mid]>key)
        {
            end = mid-1;
        }
        else{
            beg = mid+1;
        }
        mid = (beg+end)/2;
    }
    return -1;
}
int main(){
    cout<<"Enter the key:"<<endl;
    int key;
    cin>>key;
    cout<<"Enter the size of the array:"<<endl;
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    int arr[n];
    cout<<"Enter the elements of an array:"<<endl;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        cin>>arr[i];
    }
    sort(arr,arr+n);
  
    cout<<"the element is at:"<<BinarySearch(arr,n,key);
}
----------------------------Time Complexity-----------------------------------------------
Time Complexity Analysis-
 

Binary Search time complexity analysis is done below-

In each iteration or in each recursive call, the search gets reduced to half of the array.
So for n elements in the array, there are log2n iterations or recursive calls.
 

Thus, we have-

 

Time Complexity of Binary Search Algorithm is O(log2n).
Here, n is the number of elements in the sorted linear array.

 

This time complexity of binary search remains unchanged irrespective of the element position even if it is not present in the array.
