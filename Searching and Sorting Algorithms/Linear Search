Searching-
--------------
Searching is a process of finding a particular element among several given elements.
The search is successful if the required element is found.
Otherwise, the search is unsuccessful.
Searching Algorithms-
1.Linear Search
2.Binary Search
Linear Search-
----------------
Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm.
It traverses the array sequentially to locate the required element.
It searches for an element by comparing it with each element of the array one by one.
So, it is also called as Sequential Search.
----------------------------code--------------------------------------------
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int linearSearch(int arr[],int n,int key)
{
    int loc=-1;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(arr[i]==key)
        {
            loc = i;
            return loc;
        }
    }
    return loc;
}
int main(){
    cout<<"Enter the key:"<<endl;
    int key;
    cin>>key;
    cout<<"Enter the size of the array:"<<endl;
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    int arr[n];
    cout<<"Enter the elements of an array:"<<endl;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        cin>>arr[i];
    }
    cout<<"the element is at:"<<linearSearch(arr,n,key);
}
-----------------------Time Complexity---------------------
Linear Search time complexity analysis is done below-

 

Best case-
-----------
 

In the best possible case,

The element being searched may be found at the first position.
In this case, the search terminates in success with just one comparison.
Thus in best case, linear search algorithm takes O(1) operations.
 

Worst Case-
--------------
 

In the worst possible case,

The element being searched may be present at the last position or not present in the array at all.
In the former case, the search terminates in success with n comparisons.
In the later case, the search terminates in failure with n comparisons.
Thus in worst case, linear search algorithm takes O(n) operations.
 

Thus, we have-

 

Time Complexity of Linear Search Algorithm is O(n).
Here, n is the number of elements in the linear array.

 

Linear Search Efficiency-
------------------------------
 

Linear Search is less efficient when compared with other algorithms like Binary Search & Hash tables.
The other algorithms allow significantly faster searching.
